        <h2>Wezesha Program - Inclusive Education for Autistic Children</h2>
        <p>This program is a comprehensive initiative designed to empower and support autistic young people in multiple
            facets of their lives. It encompasses a holistic approach, combining educational programs tailored to their
            specific needs, a well-balanced feeding program to ensure their nutritional well-being, robust measures to
            protect them from violence and exploitation, and comprehensive sexual health and rights education to promote
            their autonomy and safety.</p>
        <p>Additionally, it provides essential guidance and resources to parents, helping them improve their livelihoods
            and become better advocates for their children. Moreover, this program aims to transform societal
            perceptions and attitudes towards children with disabilities, fostering inclusion and understanding within
            communities, ultimately creating a more inclusive and accepting environment for these exceptional young
            individuals. Our goal is to create an environment where every child can learn and grow.</p>

        <h2>Hatua Zetu Program - Campaign and Policy Advocacy</h2>
        <p>The program aims at amplifying the voices of young women and girls in all diversities in policy through
            campaign and policy advocacy. We encourage young women's and girlsâ€™ participation in decision-making spaces
            and create space for their participation at local and national levels.</p>
        <p>Our primary objectives include advocating for policies related to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights
            (SRHR) and combating violence against women, with a specific focus on ending Female Genital Mutilation
            (FGM). This initiative actively promotes the involvement of young women and girls in decision-making
            processes, ensuring they have a meaningful role at both local and national levels. By doing so, the program
            seeks to foster inclusivity, gender equality, and a safer environment for women and girls while advancing
            critical policy changes in the realm of SRHR and gender-based violence prevention.</p>

            change, and create long-lasting positive impacts on our community through art.</p>
        <p>This program harnesses the power of art as a transformative tool to educate the public and challenge
            oppressive notions and systems that undermine women and girls. Through a blend of visual, performing, and
            digital arts, this initiative aims to spark critical conversations about gender equality, empowering women,
            and dismantling harmful stereotypes.</p>
        <p>We not only showcase the resilience and achievements of women and girls but also expose the deep-seated
            biases and injustices they face. By engaging diverse audiences through artistic expression, this program
            seeks to inspire empathy, awareness, and activism, ultimately fostering a society where gender equality is
            not just a dream but a lived reality.</p>

        <p>This program is dedicated to elevating the voices of women and girls in our communities who bear the heaviest
            burdens of climate change impacts, yet have made the smallest contributions to the climate crisis.

            safeguarding their land, waterways, and other vital natural resources.</p>
        <p>We nurture creators and advocates on innovative climate solutions, including protecting and disseminating
            indigenous wisdom and policy advocacy.</p>
